# Library-Management-System
A straightforward desktop application built with Python's Tkinter library to handle basic library book borrowing and returns. Perfect for small libraries or as a demo project.

# Features
Add Books: Input book title and ID to add new entries.
Borrow/Return: Mark books as borrowed or returned, with automatic date/time stamps.
Remove Books: Delete books from the records.
View Records: Display all books in a sortable table showing title, ID, status, and date.
Edit via Selection: Click on a table row to populate input fields for quick updates.

# Requirements
Python 3.x (Tkinter is included by default in most Python installations).

# Installation
Download or copy the code into a file named library management system.py.
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

# Usage
Run the application: python library management system.py
Enter a book title and ID in the fields.
Click "Borrow" to set the book as borrowed, "Return" to mark it as returned, or "Remove" to delete it.
View and manage records in the table below. Selecting a row fills the input fields for easy editing.
Note: This is a basic in-memory system—no data is saved between sessions. For persistent storage, integrate with a database like SQLite.
